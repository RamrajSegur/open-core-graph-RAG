## 🎯 What Is It?

**OpenCoreGraphRAG** is an intelligent knowledge system that automatically extracts information from organizational data, maps relationships and connections, and answers complex questions through intelligent reasoning.

**In simple terms:** Get instant, smart answers to your business questions by automatically understanding how your organizational knowledge connects.

---

## 💡 The Problem We're Solving

Currently, accessing organizational knowledge is inefficient:
- **Finding answers takes hours or days** of manual searching across systems
- **Understanding relationships requires manual synthesis** across departments
- **Knowledge is scattered in silos** - no unified view
- **Critical insights get missed** because they're not explicitly written down
- **Manual processes don't scale** as data grows

---

## ✨ What It Does

OpenCoreGraphRAG solves this by:
1. **Automatically extracting** information from your documents and data sources
2. **Building a knowledge map** that shows how everything connects
3. **Reasoning through connections** to answer complex questions
4. **Keeping all data secure** on your servers (zero external calls)
5. **Showing the reasoning** so you understand and can verify every answer

## 🔄 How It Works

### Three Simple Steps

```
Step 1: EXTRACT              Step 2: MAP                    Step 3: REASON
Read your documents    →    Build knowledge graph    →    Answer questions
Extract:                     See connections:               By following logical chains:
- People & roles            - Who works with whom           "Show me people with
- Projects & systems        - What depends on what          cloud + fintech skills,
- Skills & experience       - Skills & relationships        available now"
- Facts & relationships     - Resources & assignments       ↓
                                                             Result: 3 people
                                                             in 5 seconds
```

### Real Example

**Question:** "Who on our sales team has experience in both financial services AND cloud infrastructure, and is available for the new automotive client?"

| Approach | Time | Result |
|----------|------|--------|
| **Manual search** | 3 hours | Maybe 1 person |
| **OpenCoreGraphRAG** | 5 seconds | 2-3 qualified people |
