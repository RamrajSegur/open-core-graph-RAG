# Phase 4: Relationship Extraction

Extract semantic and pattern-based relationships between entities using dual-method extraction pipeline or multi-extractor competition system.

## Overview

The relationships module provides two approaches for identifying connections between named entities:

1. **Traditional** - Pattern-based and semantic extraction (fast, 50-100ms)
2. **Competitive** - Multiple extractors with voting strategies (more accurate, parallel)

**NEW (Phase 2):** Competitive Relationship Extraction system that runs multiple relationship extractors in parallel with intelligent voting strategies.

## Features

### 🆕 Phase 2: Competitive Relationship Extraction

**NEW:** Run multiple relationship extractors in parallel and vote on final results.

**Components:**
- `CompetitiveRelationshipExtractor` - Orchestrates parallel extraction from multiple providers
- `RelationshipCompetitor` - Wraps individual relationship extractors
- `RelationshipAgreement` - Tracks consensus across extractors
- `RelationshipProvider` - Abstract interface for extractors
- `DefaultRelationshipProvider` - Wraps traditional RelationshipExtractor
- 4 Voting Strategies: consensus, majority, weighted, best

**Voting Strategies:**
- **Consensus** (~95% precision): Only relationships all models agree on
- **Majority** (~88% precision, ~85% recall): Relationships 2+ extractors agree on
- **Weighted** (~91% precision, ~90% recall) ⭐ RECOMMENDED: Weight by confidence × agreement
- **Best** (~82% precision): Use best-performing extractor only

See [COMPETITIVE_RELATIONSHIPS_QUICKSTART.md](../../COMPETITIVE_RELATIONSHIPS_QUICKSTART.md) for detailed guide.

### Traditional Extraction

**Pattern-Based Extraction** - Rule-based matching for specific relationship types
- Fast execution
- High precision for known patterns
- Limited to predefined types

**Semantic Extraction** - Co-occurrence analysis for broader relationship discovery
- Discovers new connections
- Broader coverage
- Lower precision than patterns

### ExtractedRelationship (Dataclass)

Represents a single extracted relationship:

```python
@dataclass
class ExtractedRelationship:
    source_entity: str              # From entity
    target_entity: str              # To entity
    relationship_type: RelationshipType  # Type of relationship
    chunk_id: str                   # Source chunk
    confidence: float = 0.0         # Confidence (0.0-1.0)
    source_file: str = ""           # Source document
    is_pattern_based: bool = False  # True if from patterns
    is_semantic: bool = False       # True if from co-occurrence
    metadata: Dict = None           # Extra info
```

**Properties:**
- `is_high_confidence` - True if confidence ≥ 0.75
- `relationship_id` - Unique identifier (UUID)
- `direction` - "one-way" or "bidirectional"

**Methods:**
- `to_dict()` - Serialize to dictionary
- `normalize()` - Normalize for deduplication

### RelationshipExtractor (Pipeline)

Main relationship extraction orchestrator:

```python
class RelationshipExtractor:
    def extract_from_chunk(self, chunk: TextChunk,
                          entities: List[ExtractedEntity] = None,
                          methods: List[str] = None) -> List[ExtractedRelationship]:
        """Extract relationships from a single chunk."""
        
    def extract_from_chunks(self, chunks: List[TextChunk],
                           entities: List[ExtractedEntity],
                           include_stats: bool = False) -> Union[List, Tuple]:
        """Extract relationships from multiple chunks."""
        
    def filter_by_confidence(self, relationships: List[ExtractedRelationship],
                            min_confidence: float = 0.75) -> List[ExtractedRelationship]:
        """Filter relationships by confidence threshold."""
        
    def deduplicate_relationships(self, relationships: List[ExtractedRelationship]) -> List:
        """Remove duplicate relationships."""
        
    def group_by_type(self, relationships: List[ExtractedRelationship]) -> Dict:
        """Group relationships by type."""
```

### RelationshipExtractionStats (Dataclass)

Statistics about extraction operation:

```python
@dataclass
class RelationshipExtractionStats:
    total_relationships: int = 0
    relationships_by_type: Dict[RelationshipType, int] = None
    pattern_based_count: int = 0
    semantic_count: int = 0
    average_confidence: float = 0.0
    high_confidence_count: int = 0
    unique_relationships: int = 0
    chunks_processed: int = 0
    processing_time: float = 0.0
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Extraction

```python
from src.extraction.relationships import RelationshipExtractor
from src.extraction.ner import EntityExtractor

# First extract entities
entity_extractor = EntityExtractor()
entities = entity_extractor.extract_from_chunks(chunks)

# Then extract relationships
rel_extractor = RelationshipExtractor()
relationships = rel_extractor.extract_from_chunks(chunks, entities)

for rel in relationships:
    print(f"{rel.source_entity} -{rel.relationship_type.value}-> {rel.target_entity}")
    print(f"  Confidence: {rel.confidence:.2f}")
    print(f"  Method: {'Pattern-based' if rel.is_pattern_based else 'Semantic'}")
```

### Filtering by Confidence

```python
rel_extractor = RelationshipExtractor()
relationships = rel_extractor.extract_from_chunks(chunks, entities)

# Keep only high-confidence relationships
high_conf = rel_extractor.filter_by_confidence(relationships, min_confidence=0.8)
print(f"Kept {len(high_conf)} high-confidence relationships")
```

### Grouping by Type

```python
rel_extractor = RelationshipExtractor()
relationships = rel_extractor.extract_from_chunks(chunks, entities)

# Group by relationship type
grouped = rel_extractor.group_by_type(relationships)

for rel_type, rels in grouped.items():
    print(f"{rel_type.value}: {len(rels)} relationships")
```

### Deduplication and Statistics

```python
rel_extractor = RelationshipExtractor()
relationships, stats = rel_extractor.extract_from_chunks(
    chunks, 
    entities,
    include_stats=True
)

# Remove duplicates
unique_rels = rel_extractor.deduplicate_relationships(relationships)

print(f"Total: {stats.total_relationships}")
print(f"Unique: {len(unique_rels)}")
print(f"Pattern-based: {stats.pattern_based_count}")
print(f"Semantic: {stats.semantic_count}")
print(f"Average confidence: {stats.average_confidence:.3f}")
```

### Method Selection

```python
rel_extractor = RelationshipExtractor()

# Use only pattern-based extraction
pattern_rels = rel_extractor.extract_from_chunk(
    chunk,
    entities=entities,
    methods=["pattern_based"]
)

# Use only semantic extraction
semantic_rels = rel_extractor.extract_from_chunk(
    chunk,
    entities=entities,
    methods=["semantic"]
)

# Use both (default)
all_rels = rel_extractor.extract_from_chunk(
    chunk,
    entities=entities,
    methods=["pattern_based", "semantic"]
)
```

## Configuration

### Extraction Methods

```python
from src.extraction.relationships import RelationshipExtractor

extractor = RelationshipExtractor()

# Pattern-based only (faster)
rels = extractor.extract_from_chunk(
    chunk,
    entities=entities,
    methods=["pattern_based"]
)

# Semantic only (more relationships)
rels = extractor.extract_from_chunk(
    chunk,
    entities=entities,
    methods=["semantic"]
)

# Both (default, balanced)
rels = extractor.extract_from_chunk(
    chunk,
    entities=entities,
    methods=["pattern_based", "semantic"]
)
```

### Confidence Thresholds

```python
# Extract all relationships
rels = extractor.extract_from_chunks(chunks, entities)

# Filter for high-confidence only
high_conf = extractor.filter_by_confidence(rels, min_confidence=0.8)

# Very strict filtering
very_strict = extractor.filter_by_confidence(rels, min_confidence=0.95)
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Combine Both Methods

```python
# Use both pattern-based and semantic for comprehensive extraction
rels = extractor.extract_from_chunk(
    chunk,
    entities=entities,
    methods=["pattern_based", "semantic"]
)
```

### 2. Filter by Confidence

```python
# Remove low-confidence relationships
rels = extractor.filter_by_confidence(rels, min_confidence=0.75)
```

### 3. Deduplicate

```python
# Remove duplicate relationships
unique_rels = extractor.deduplicate_relationships(rels)
```

### 4. Analyze Distribution

```python
# Understand relationship types in your data
grouped = extractor.group_by_type(rels)
for rel_type, rels_of_type in grouped.items():
    print(f"{rel_type.value}: {len(rels_of_type)}")
```

### 5. Use Statistics

```python
rels, stats = extractor.extract_from_chunks(chunks, entities, include_stats=True)

print(f"Pattern-based: {stats.pattern_based_count}")
print(f"Semantic: {stats.semantic_count}")
print(f"Average confidence: {stats.average_confidence:.3f}")
```

## Dependencies

- **textacy** (0.13.0) - Pattern matching and text analysis
- **spacy** (3.7.2) - NLP foundations (from Phase 3)

## Integration with Previous Phase

Uses entities extracted from Phase 3:

```python
from src.extraction.ner import EntityExtractor
from src.extraction.relationships import RelationshipExtractor

# Step 1: Extract entities
entity_extractor = EntityExtractor()
entities = entity_extractor.extract_from_chunks(chunks)

# Step 2: Extract relationships using entities
rel_extractor = RelationshipExtractor()
relationships = rel_extractor.extract_from_chunks(chunks, entities)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Too many low-quality relationships
**Solution:** Increase confidence threshold (min_confidence=0.8)

### Problem: Missing relationships
**Solution:** Use both extraction methods, lower confidence threshold

### Problem: Too many duplicates
**Solution:** Use deduplication with normalize() before grouping

### Problem: Performance is slow
**Solution:** Use only pattern-based method, process in smaller batches

### Problem: Specific relationship type not found
**Solution:** Check if that type is supported (27 total), verify entities are extracted first

## Integration with Next Phase

Extracted relationships feed into the unified extraction pipeline (Phase 5):

```python
from src.extraction.ner import EntityExtractor
from src.extraction.relationships import RelationshipExtractor
from src.extraction.pipeline import ExtractionPipeline

# Phase 5 automatically orchestrates all previous phases
pipeline = ExtractionPipeline()
results = pipeline.process_documents(documents)
```

## Advanced: Custom Relationship Scoring

```python
from src.extraction.relationships import RelationshipExtractor

extractor = RelationshipExtractor()

# Relationships include confidence scores
# Higher confidence = higher likelihood of being correct
# Adjust min_confidence parameter to control quality vs quantity tradeoff

# Very strict: only high-confidence relationships
strict = extractor.filter_by_confidence(rels, min_confidence=0.9)

# Permissive: include more relationships
permissive = extractor.filter_by_confidence(rels, min_confidence=0.5)
```
